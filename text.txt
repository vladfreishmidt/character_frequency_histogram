Really enjoyed this episode 7 of Andor! It was pretty slow but the dialogues are so well written that I didn't even see the time pass! Also, we have to talk about the soundtrack at the end, I did NOT see that coming from Nicholas Britell! It felt a bit short so I wanted to extend, it, here it is! It's the same tune that plays when we first discover Niamos, as well as the nightclub track on Morlana One, in Episode 1.

Encore un magnifique épisode d'Andor, cette fois surtout au niveau des dialogues, énormément d'enjeu à chaque prise de parole, je n'ai pas vu le temps passer! Par contre, je ne m'attendais pas à autant d'exploration sonore de la part de Nicholas Britell!
